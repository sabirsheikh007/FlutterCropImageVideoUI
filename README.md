# FlutterCropImageVideoUI
A custom Flutter widget for cropping images and videos. Users can select aspect ratios (1:1, 16:9, 9:16), scale and move the media, and get crop coordinates. These coordinates can be used with FFmpeg to apply the crop. Ideal for creating media editing apps with customizable crop functionality.
